# $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR defines the base directory relative to which user-specific
# non-essential runtime files and other file objects (such as sockets, named
# pipes, ...) should be stored. The directory MUST be owned by the user, and he
# MUST be the only one having read and write access to it. Its Unix access mode
# MUST be 0700.

# permission.
