#
# This script takes ownership of the specified file/directory.  It is friendly
# with directories mapped (mounted) to a network share.  The strategy adopted
# is to change/set ownership only for files/directories that don't already have
# the correct ownership.
#
# CIFS: Basically, ownership and permissions of files/folders of the share are
#       defined when mounting the share on the client side.  The chown/chmod
#       commands are ignored: ownership and permissions changes are not applied,
#       even when the command succeed.
#         - All files/folders have the same permissions and they cannot be
#           changed.
#         - All files/folders have the same ownership, no matter which user
#           creates the file.
#       The `noperm` mount option disables permission checks on client side.  So
#       any users can read or modify files, even if they technically could not
#       according to permissions.
#       When using an SMB share, the `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` environment
#       variables should match the user/group used to mount of the SMB share.
#
# NFS: The NFS mount on client side behaves like a normal folder, i.e. ownership
#      and permissions are the same between the client and the server.  However,
#      the `root` user might be handled differently depending on the server
#      configuration.
#      When the `no_root_squash` server option is set, the behavior remains the
#      same: the `root` user on the client side is mapped to the `root` user on
#      the server side.
#      Using the `root_squash` server option allows the `root` user on the
#      client side to be mapped to a different user (called anonymous user) on
#      server side.  The anonymous user can be explicitly set via `anonuid` and
#      `anongid` (the default is `nobody`, user ID 65534).  So because the
#      container applies ownership of files and folders under the `root` user,
#      we may end up in a situation where the container is not able to perform
#      this task.
#      When using an NFS share, the user may have to set ownership/permissions
#      prior starting the container, adjust `USER_ID` and `GROUP_ID` correctly
#      or adjust the NFS server options.
#

Take ownership of the specified file/directory.

Options:
  --not-recursive  Take ownership of the specified directory only, not its
                   content.
  --fail           Exit with non-zero value if ownership fails to be set for at
                   least one file or folder.
  --user-id ID     ID of the user that should own the directory.  If not set,
                   the USER_ID environment variable is used.
  --group-id ID    ID of the group that should own the directory.  If not set,
                   the GROUP_ID environment variable is used.

Arguments:
  TARGET           Path to the file/directory to take ownership.
